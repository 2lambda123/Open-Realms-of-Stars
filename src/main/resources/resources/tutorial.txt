00|Start|Start of Open Realm of Stars|Welcome to play Open Realm of Stars. This game is 4X(eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) space strategy game. Your objective is to become most powerful realm in the galaxy.
01|Start|First planet|Each realm has home planet. Home planets have only space port unless playing with ancient realm. Each planet produces food, metal, production, credits, research and culture. Food is required for population growth. Metal and production are required for building ships and buildings. Credits can be used for many things like rushing building. Research is used for studying new technology and culture is used for gaining more influence in galaxy.
02|Start|First Building|Each planet is has one building project. This can be either ship or building. It is highly recommend to have basic factory as a first building at home planet. Double click the planet and select your first building project.
05|Movement|Basic movement|Space ships have two ways of move FTL and regular engine. FTL movement is done by clicking route button or pressing R key. Then target sector is selected and fleet moves after end turn. Regular engine move is done when fleet is selected and pressing arrows keys or num pad keys. Also left clicking mouse on star map works.
06|Movement|Exploring the space|Exploring the space should be done with regular engine. Moving in FTL makes scanner work when fleet stops. This will make blind spots unless fleet's scanners are not effective enough.
07|Movement|Exploring with Colony|Colony ship can be also used for space exploration. Just try to avoid risks like pirate space station and space anomalies and not wander too far way from the home planet so that if new colonizable planet is found colony ship can quickly get population on board.
12|Research|Boosting research|Research is done in separate research view. At the beginning of the game is very important to get basic lab building as fast as possible. Go to research view and increase research of Improvements so that new technology will be discovered at least in 9 turns.
13|Research|Research view|When 50% or more is discovered in technology level there is possibility to skip next level. In that case rest of the technologies in current level are skipped but one can start study immediately technology on next level. It is still possible to get these skipped technologies in diplomatic trades. Skipping is done when clicking the green up arrow next in research view. Each technology field has their own up arrows.
20|Planet|Planet discovered|If planet is habitable by your Realm, select starting colony ship and move at least single population to fleet and send it to colonize this planet. More planets realm has generally more powerful realm is. Not all planets are habitable by all space races. There are also some terraforming technologies which allow realm to colonize planets with higher radiation.
21|Planet|Gas Giant|Gas giants are huge planets which are not habitable. They can block fleet movement and also scanners are blocked by gas giants.
30|Objects in Space|Space anomaly|Space anomaly is unexplored local phenomena in space. By moving fleet on same sector reveals hidden secret from the space anomaly. These secrets can be positive or in some cases negative. Exploring these with strong military ship is recommend and not using colony or trade ships.
31|Objects in Space|Black hole|There is one super massive black hole in center of the galaxy. Super massive black hole blocks movement of space fleets.
32|Objects in Space|Deep Space Anchor|Deep space anchor is stable and safe place to build massive star bases. Any realm can deploy star base on free Deep Space Anchor by moving the star base on sector and viewing the fleet and pressing the Deploy star base button. Only deployed star base can use weapons in combat. Deployed star bases are also able to use star base modules to create culture, credits or research.
33|Objects in Space|Wormhole|Worm hole is found from space anomaly. Worm hole transfers fleet into random position in galaxy when fleet moves into same sector as wormhole.
50|Space Combat|Space Combat|Space combat happens when two different realms fleet encounter in same sector. Combat happens in 9x9 arena. Each area can contain single ship. Attacker ships are at bottom and defender's ships are at up. Ships are placed in initiative order and the fastest ship will start the combat. Ships can move depending their working engine.\n\nShips can have five different kind of weapons: Beam, Massdrives, Photon Torpedos, Missile or ECM missiles. Weapons are used by clicking the component button on right handside. Then cursor changes to crosshair. Then target can be selected if it is in weapon range. Space combat ends when another fleet is totally destroyed or escaped. There is also chance to get tie if no ship cannot cause damage to another ship.\n\nShips can have three different kind of defensive components: shield, armor and jammers. These are used automatically. Like are almost every other components too.
51|Space Combat|Beam weapons|Beam weapons have shortest range of all weapons, but these will have greatest hitting accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 100%. Beam weapons are excellent against armors but they can be easily deflected with shields.
52|Space Combat|Mass drives|Mass drives have medium range of all weapons and these will have medium hit accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 75%. Mass drives are excellent againts shields but armors can easily deflect their damage.
53|Space Combat|Photon Torpedos|Photon torpedos have medium range of all weapons and these will have medium hit accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 75%. Photon torpedos are excellent againts armors but they can be easily deflected with shields.
54|Space Combat|Missiles|Missile weapons have high range but have low accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 50%. Missile weapons are great againts shields but armors can protect against them more efficiently.
55|Space Combat|ECM Missile| ECM missiles have very high range but low accuracy. Hitting accuracy againt medium ships is 50%. ECM Missile do not cause hull damage. They cause direct damage to shields. They do not cause damage either to armors.
56|Space Combat|Shields|Shields are protective component. These are good againts Beam weapons and photon torpedos. Shields are regenerated after one full combat turn. So it is important to more than once against shielded ship.
57|Space Combat|Armors|Armors are protective component. These are good against mass drives and missile weapons. Armors will also work even without power. Armors are fixed automatically after combat but not during the combat.
58|Space Combat|Jammers|Jammers make the hitting more difficult against the ship. These are general purpose protective components which work against every weapon system. Of course these are weaker against beam weapons since they have highest accuracy.
59|Space Combat|Privateering|Privateering happens in space combat. Privateer ship moves next to trade ship and then privateer component is selected to use. Cursor changes to skull icon and trade ship can be looted now. Note that after looting trade ships needs to travel back to planet to get more cargo.
90|Diplomacy|Diplomacy with other Realms|Diplomacy is very important part of the game. With diplomacy realms can join into different type of alliances which benefit both parties. With diplomacy it is also possible to trade technology, fleets and planets. Planets are usually trade only when trying to make peace after long war. Realms also remember how they were treated previously. If they were treated badly, they will treat you also badly. If they are treated good they will treat you also good. Also military power difference is important. Aggressive realms can make war with weaker realms if military power difference grows too large.
91|Diplomacy|Technology trading|Diplomacy allows trading technology between two realms. Technology can be traded for another technology, credits or any other tradeable. Better technology is much more expensive than early game technology.
92|Diplomacy|Map trading|There are two different maps which are tradeable: Full galaxy maps and colonized planet maps. Trading full maps is always a risk your realm has discovered colonized planet which you haven't colonized yet. Other realm might have time to colonized faster than you. Full galaxy map might also reveal where are other possible realms and what parts of galaxy has been studied. After forming trade alliance it is useful to trade maps so that trade fleets can start trading. Therefore there is possiblity to trade map of colonized planets of the realms.
93|Diplomacy|Fleet trading|In diplomacy trading it is possible to trade fleets between other realms. Sometimes it makes sense to sell obsolete fleets for another realms. Having lot's of fleet costs also credit so why not sell old ones and get few credits for those. Usually realms are not willing to sell fleet unless they really are not needed anymore. Sometimes it is possible to get fleets when making peacy treaty after long war.
94|Diplomacy|Planet trading|In diplomacy trading it is possible to planets to other realms. Trading planets are only done in very grave situation. Other realm must be much stronger than the other and promise to have peace after trade.
95|Diplomacy|Espionage trade|If both realms have espionage they can trade this information between each others. This will give boost for espionage against third realm. Espionage trades last 20 turns.
96|Diplomacy|Diplomacy victory|There is possiblity to win Open Realm of Stars by diplomacy. It requires becoming candidate of ruler of the galaxy. First realm who builds required amount of United Galaxy Tower will become first candidate for ruler of the galaxy. Second candidate is voted. It can be based on military power or whom has most of the United Galaxy Towers. After this is final voting for Galaxy Ruler from these two candidates. There is also possibility to have more diplomatic votes, depending on galaxy settings. These votings can be made as promises on diplomatic trades.
97|Diplomacy|Voting promises|Realms can promise or ask another realm to vote certainly. These promises can cost quite a lot. If these promises are kept it will give diplomatic bonuses between these realms and on the other hand if they are broken this will give negative diplomatic bonuses.
98|Diplomacy|Galactic Olympics|Galactic olympics can be arrange to boost realms diplomatic bonuses. Each realm can decided if they want to participate on these games. If they participate there will diplomatic bonuses between participants and organizer. If realm decides to boycott games, there will be negative bonus between realm who boycotted and organizer. On the other hand all realms who boycotted the games will get diplomatic bonuses between each others.
100|Diplomacy|Peace treaty|Peace treaty is start of friendship. It forbids space combat and planetary invasions between two realms. Fleets are not allowed enter other realms sector. Long lasting peace gives diplomatic bonus between two realms.
101|Diplomacy|Trade alliance|Trade alliance between two realms allows non combat fleets to enter other realm sectors. Therefore trade alliance allows trade fleets to go other realm planets to make trade. Trading benefits both parties for gaining extra credit.
102|Diplomacy|Defensive pact|Defensive pact is deeper alliance than trade alliance. It allows military ships go realms sector. Also if third realm make war against either realm in defensive pact that war will start against all parties in defensive pact. Defensive pact does not make ware if one member of defensive pact makes war against third party.
103|Diplomacy|Alliance|Alliance is the deepest form of two realms working together. There can be only two realms in alliance. Alliance has same military benefits as in defensive pact. If one the alliance party makes war against third party another realm in alliance is not in war against the third party. Alliance scores and victory conditions are combined. For example culture points are added together. Same goes also for technological achievement or victory domination. In short to say when checking the victory conditions realms in alliance are treated as a single realm.
104|Diplomacy|Trade embargo|Trade embargo is agreement of two realms where to announce embargo against the third realm. Realms making the trade embargo gain diplomatic bonuses towards each others. Third realm gets negative diplomacy bonuses. Trade embargo lasts always 20 turns. When it ends diplomatic relation goes back to peace or stays in war if there is war. When trade embargo status is between two realms these two realms cannot send trade fleets towards each others. Regular diplomatic trades are allowed.
105|Diplomacy|War|War allows space combat and planetary invasions between two realms. Realm who starts the war gets negative diplomacy bonus towards all other realms. Long lasting wars are expensive for non-hivemind governments. Having wars will increase war exhaust on realms which makes people unhappy.
