00|Start|Start of Open Realm of Stars|Welcome to play Open Realm of Stars. This game is 4X(eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) space strategy game. Your objective is to become most powerful realm in the galaxy.
01|Start|First planet|Each realm has home planet. Home planets have only space port unless playing with ancient realm. Each planet produces food, metal, production, credits, research and culture. Food is required for population growth. Metal and production are required for building ships and buildings. Credits can be used for many things like rushing building. Research is used for studying new technology and culture is used for gainaing more influence in galaxy.
02|Start|First Building|Each planet is has one building project. This can be either ship or building. It is highly recommend to have basic factory as a first building at home planet. Double click the planet and select your first building project.
05|Movement|Basic movement|Space ships have two ways of move FTL and regular engine. FTL movement is done by clicking route button or pressing R key. Then target sector is selected and fleet moves after end turn. Regular engine move is done when fleet is selected and pressing arrows keys or num pad keys. Also left clicking mouse on star map works.
06|Movement|Exploring the space|Exploring the space should be done with regular engine. Moving in FTL makes scanner work when fleet stops. This will make blind spots unless fleet's scanners are not effective enough.
07|Movement|Exploring with Colony|Colony ship can be also used for space exploration. Just try to avoid risks like pirate space station and space anomalies and not wander too far way from the home planet so that if new colonizable planet is found colony ship can quickly get population on board.
12|Research|Boosting research|Research is done in separate research view. At the beginning of the game is very important to get basic lab building as fast as possible. Go to research view and increase research of Improvements so that new technology will be discovered at least in 9 turns.
13|Research|Research view|When 50% or more is discovered in technology level there is possibility to skip next level. In that case rest of the technologies in current level are skipped but one can start study immediately technology on next level. It is still possible to get these skipped technologies in diplomatic trades. Skipping is done when clicking the green up arrow next in research view. Each technology field has their own up arrows.
20|Planet|Planet discovered|If planet is habitable by your Realm, select starting colony ship and move at least single population to fleet and send it to colonize this planet. More planets realm has generally more powerful realm is. Not all planets are habitable by all space races. There are also some terraforming technologies which allow realm to colonize planets with higher radiation.
21|Planet|Gas Giant|Gas giants are huge planets which are not habitable. They can block fleet movement and also scanners are blocked by gas giants.
30|Objects in Space|Space anomaly|Space anomaly is unexplored local phenomena in space. By moving fleet on same sector reveals hidden secret from the space anomaly. These secrets can be positive or in some cases negative. Exploring these with strong military ship is recommend and not using colony or trade ships.
31|Objects in Space|Black hole|There is one super massive black hole in center of the galaxy. Super massive black hole blocks movement of space fleets.
32|Objects in Space|Deep Space Anchor|Deep space anchor is stable and safe place to build massive star bases. Any realm can deploy star base on free Deep Space Anchor by moving the star base on sector and viewing the fleet and pressing the Deploy star base button. Only deployed star base can use weapons in combat. Deployed star bases are also able to use star base modules to create culture, credits or research.
33|Objects in Space|Wormhole|Worm hole is found from space anomaly. Worm hole transfers fleet into random position in galaxy when fleet moves into same sector as wormhole.
50|Space Combat|Space Combat|Space combat happens when two different realms fleet encounter in same sector. Combat happens in 9x9 arena. Each area can contain single ship. Attacker ships are at bottom and defender's ships are at up. Ships are placed in initiative order and the fastest ship will start the combat. Ships can move depending their working engine.\n\nShips can have five different kind of weapons: Beam, Massdrives, Photon Torpedos, Missile or ECM missiles. Weapons are used by clicking the component button on right handside. Then cursor changes to crosshair. Then target can be selected if it is in weapon range. Space combat ends when another fleet is totally destroyed or escaped. There is also chance to get tie if no ship cannot cause damage to another ship.\n\nShips can have three different kind of defensive components: shield, armor and jammers. These are used automatically. Like are almost every other components too.
51|Space Combat|Beam weapons|Beam weapons have shortest range of all weapons, but these will have greatest hitting accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 100%. Beam weapons are excellent against armors but they can be easily deflected with shields.
52|Space Combat|Mass drives|Mass drives have medium range of all weapons and these will have medium hit accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 75%. Mass drives are excellent againts shields but armors can easily deflect their damage.
53|Space Combat|Photon Torpedos|Photon torpedos have medium range of all weapons and these will have medium hit accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 75%. Photon torpedos are excellent againts armors but they can be easily deflected with shields.
54|Space Combat|Missiles|Missile weapons have high range but have low accuracy. Hitting accuracy against medium ships is 50%. Missile weapons are great againts shields but armors can protect against them more efficiently.
55|Space Combat|ECM Missile| ECM missiles have very high range but low accuracy. Hitting accuracy againt medium ships is 50%. ECM Missile do not cause hull damage. They cause direct damage to shields. They do not cause damage either to armors.
56|Space Combat|Shields|Shields are protective component. These are good againts Beam weapons and photon torpedos. Shields are regenerated after one full combat turn. So it is important to more than once against shielded ship.
57|Space Combat|Armors|Armors are protective component. These are good against mass drives and missile weapons. Armors will also work even without power. Armors are fixed automatically after combat but not during the combat.
58|Space Combat|Jammers|Jammers make the hitting more difficult against the ship. These are general purpose protective components which work against every weapon system. Of course these are weaker against beam weapons since they have highest accuracy.
59|Space Combat|Privateering|Privateering happens in space combat. Privateer ship moves next to trade ship and then privateer component is selected to use. Cursor changes to skull icon and trade ship can be looted now. Note that after looting trade ships needs to travel back to planet to get more cargo.
