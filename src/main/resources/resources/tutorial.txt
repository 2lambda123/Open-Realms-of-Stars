00|Start|Start of Open Realm of Stars|Welcome to play Open Realm of Stars. This game is 4X(eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) space strategy game. Your objective is to become most powerful realm in the galaxy.
01|Start|First planet|Each realm has home planet. Home planets have only space port unless playing with ancient realm. Each planet produces food, metal, production, credits, research and culture. Food is required for population growth. Metal and production are required for building ships and buildings. Credits can be used for many things like rushing building. Research is used for studying new technology and culture is used for gainaing more influence in galaxy.
02|Start|First Building|Each planet is has one building project. This can be either ship or building. It is highly recommend to have basic factory as a first building at home planet. Double click the planet and select your first building project.
05|Movement|Basic movement|Space ships have two ways of move FTL and regular engine. FTL movement is done by clicking route button or pressing R key. Then target sector is selected and fleet moves after end turn. Regular engine move is done when fleet is selected and pressing arrows keys or num pad keys. Also left clicking mouse on star map works.
06|Movement|Exploring the space|Exploring the space should be done with regular engine. Moving in FTL makes scanner work when fleet stops. This will make blind spots unless fleet's scanners are not effective enough.
07|Movement|Exploring with Colony|Colony ship can be also used for space exploration. Just try to avoid risks like pirate space station and space anomalies and not wander too far way from the home planet so that if new colonizable planet is found colony ship can quickly get population on board.
12|Research|Boosting research|Research is done in separate research view. At the beginning of the game is very important to get basic lab building as fast as possible. Go to research view and increase research of Improvements so that new technology will be discovered at least in 9 turns.
13|Research|Research view|When 50% or more is discovered in technology level there is possibility to skip next level. In that case rest of the technologies in current level are skipped but one can start study immediately technology on next level. It is still possible to get these skipped technologies in diplomatic trades. Skipping is done when clicking the green up arrow next in research view. Each technology field has their own up arrows.
20|Planet|Planet discovered|If planet is habitable by your Realm, select starting colony ship and move at least single population to fleet and send it to colonize this planet. Move planets realm has generally more powerful realm is. Not all planets are habitable by all space races. There are also some terraforming technologies which allow realm to colonize planets with higher radiation.
21|Planet|Gas Giant|Gas giants are huge planets which are not habitable. They can block fleet movement and also scanners are blocked by gas giants.
30|Objects in Space|Space anomaly|Space anomaly is unexplored local phenomena in space. By moving fleet on same sector reveals hidden secret from the space anomaly. These secrets can be positive or in some cases negative. Exploring these with strong military ship is recommend and not using colony or trade ships.
31|Objects in Space|Black hole|There is one super massive black hole in center of the galaxy. Super massive black hole blocks movement of space fleets.
32|Objects in Space|Deep Space Anchor|Deep space anchor is stable and safe place to build massive star bases. Any realm can deploy star base on free Deep Space Anchor by moving the star base on sector and viewing the fleet and pressing the Deploy star base button. Only deployed star base can use weapons in combat. Deployed star bases are also able to use star base modules to create culture, credits or research.
33|Objects in Space|Wormhole|Worm hole is found from space anomaly. Worm hole transfers fleet into random position in galaxy when fleet moves into same sector as wormhole.
